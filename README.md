## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

For this project, we selected two datasets:

1. **[Data Science Job Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar62/datascience-job-data)**  
   This dataset includes information on job candidates applying for data science roles, covering demographic details, education background, work experience, and training hours.  
   - **Target variable**: Whether a candidate is actively looking for a new job (1) or not (0)  
   - **Size**: 19,158 samples  
   - **Notes**: Contains outliers, missing values, and potentially irrelevant columns requiring data cleaning

2. **[Cleaned – Jobs and Salaries in Data Science](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malingarajapaksha/cleaned)**  
   This dataset contains 5,341 entries and focuses on salaries within the data science field, which is missing in the first dataset.  
   - **Size**: 5,341 samples  
   - **Notes**: Already cleaned and structured, suitable for analyzing salary trends and job fields in data science

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

## Milestone 2 (18th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**


## Milestone 3 (30th May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**


## Late policy

- < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
- < 48h: 70% of the grade for the milestone
